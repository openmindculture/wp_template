# WordPress Template / Hybrid-Classic Starter Theme Boilerplate

This opinionated development template focuses on minimalism and does not follow the official WordPress ways.

⚠️ This repository is not actively maintained anymore! Please consider [`openmindculture/wp-impact-theme`](https://github.com/openmindculture/wp-impact-theme/) as a more up-to-date template!

- prefer vanilla CSS for any kind of customization
- prefer lintable CSS code to CSS-in-JS (`theme.json` values)
- prefer codeless custom blocks without Webpack, without React, without SCSS
- prefer modern, PSR-style, PHP code instead of legacy WordPress code style
- prefer custom page markup to bloated WP core output
- prefer clean code and webperformance optimization

This repository is already outdated! See open issues!

[wp_template](https://github.com/openmindculture/wp_template) is a simple local host WordPress setup using Docker, docker compose, wp-cli, and PostCSS to install, develop, and test themes and plugins. It was forked from [wp_cli_docker](https://github.com/openmindculture/wp_cli_docker). This template can help you build a classic (child) theme from scratch (without exporting from the block editor), that follows the official WordPress coding standards. We can still support and provide custom blocks in our theme.

Roadmap / development: this repository should be kept up to date to reflect the current best practices, but otherwise it should remain a minimal template without too many features added.

### WordPress Coding Style Incompatibility after 1.0.0

After `1.0.0`, a mostly stable beta releae with SCSS and WordPress code style, I removed both SCSS and WP syntax tools in favor of a more minimal and modern codebase, which is no longer suitable for developing themes or plugins that pass the official review process!

To avoid confusion, I will keep the new codebase in its feature branch or even fork another distinct repository. You can follow the latest work in progress in the <strike>[`minimalism-config` feature branch](https://github.com/openmindculture/wp_template/tree/minimalism-config)</strike> or the more recent forked repository, [wp_template_opinionated](https://github.com/openmindculture/wp_template_opinionated/). The new codebase will follow a classic approach, possibly independent of any parent theme, but possibly inspired by Twenty-Twenty-Three and GeneratePress.

## Usage

- `npm install` initialize and start the development environment
- `npm start` should start up WordPress on http://localhost:8765/
- `npm run build` rebuilds and exports the theme's CSS and PHP files
- `npm run watch` adds file watcher to automatically rebuild the theme.
- `npm stop` stops the server without destroying data and configuration.
- `npm run destroy` removes the installation and its data.

## Requirements

- npm
- Docker
- docker-compose

## Configuration

### Set Theme name and Target Directory

- Create a subdirectory below `themes` matching your theme name.
- Open `package.json` and edit `build:core`, `"build:scss:sass:theme`, `build:scss:postcss:theme` etc. accordingly.
- Edit `build:core` to make sure all necessary files will be exported.
- Edit your `style.css` and `theme.json` to match name, author, version etc.

### Modify localhost Port and Domain

The server listens on port 8765 by default, so you can enter http://localhost:8765/ to open WordPress in your browser. Modifying the port not only allows you to run multiple local projects at the same time, but it can also prevent browser caching issues between different local WordPress servers and ensure that cross-domain resources, paid plugins or fonts etc. will be displayed correctly.

You can also set a local domain name that matches your future production server, by adding the domain as a localhost alias in `/etc/hosts` and configuring WordPress to use that domain. A port set to `80` can be omitted in the url, so http://example.com:80/ is equivalent to http://example.com/ and might facilitate testing even more.

Edit the port mapping for the `wordpress:` service in `docker-compose.yml` and change the first value to whatever port you want to use in your browser.

Edit the `installCore` function in `install-local-environment.js` and change `--url=http://localhost:8765"` to the appropriate URL.

Edit `/etc/hosts` and add the local domain alias:

```
127.0.0.1	localhost example.com www.example.com
```

Add an offloader, load balancer, or reverse proxy to add advanced server functionality like https.

### Configure pre-installed Themes and Plugins

Modify [install-local-environment.js](./install-local-environment.js) to select which themes and plugins will be installed automatically using `wp-cli`. You must specify the technical names (text domains), not the current titles! The technical names are the same as the directory names in the plugin paths.

```js
/* specify the technical names (text domain) of plugins to be installed */
'wp plugin install incompatibility-status updraftplus --activate';
```

Some commercial / paid plugins cannot be installed automatically. They have to be uploaded or installed manually later.

### Configure WordPress Core, Web Server, PHP Version used

Modify [docker/WordPress.Dockerfile](./docker/WordPress.Dockerfile) to choose one of various predefined configurations using different PHP versions like 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 etc. and popular web servers like Apache or nginx to copy our customer's web hosting provider's technical setup as good as possible.

See https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/ for available docker tags, or keep `wordpress:latest` for the newest (latest) stable release.

```Dockerfile
FROM wordpress:latest
# use other tags in docker/wordpress.Dockerfile to test specific versions, see
# https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/
# FROM wordpress:6.1.1-php8.0-apache
```

## Child Theme, Block Patterns, and Optional Must-Use-Plugin

- The theme in a subdirectory of `/themes` will be rebuilt when `/src` files have changed.
- Use (S)CSS and write verbose code in `/src`.
	- (TODO: remove SCSS from default setup, replace with CSS next syntax using [PostCSS](https://postcss.org))
	- (TODO: configure PostCSS to support native CSS nesting and other upcoming features, to be exported to compatible fallbacks)
	- (TODO: add PHP configuration to remove unnecessary bloat and cargo code like wp-emoji or jQuery)
- Add or configure other build tools, like minifying or transpiling if needed.
- Create a zip archive of that subdirectory to export the theme to another WordPress installation.

Known issue: [block patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/) defined as .php files in the child theme's `patterns` directory seemed to be ignored in a `twentytwentythree-child` theme, while they did work when copying the files directly into the parent theme's pattern directory, or when using other, probably more classic, themes, like GeneratePress.

The best practice for a quick, minimal, and standards compliant setup, is to create a child theme of an official or popular theme that provides most of the required functionality.

If we need to define custom data structures, we can use the popular [ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) to provide custom fields, and use our own minimal plugin to define custom post types. This should not be part of the theme, to prevent data loss when a theme is changed or deactivated. Using a must-use plugin ensures that the code will always be active. Custom fields defined using the ACF user interface in WordPress admin can be exported to JSON or PHP, so we can add it to our custom fields plugin as well.

To persist other important content like example posts or pages, use the default WordPress exporter to save an XML export as `content.xml`, which will automatically be imported when setting up the local environment using `npm install`. The data might have to be installed manually when setting up a production environment.

For the sake of simplicity, our example setup uses a single-file plugin and puts all styles directly into a single `style.css` file without using further `theme.css` or `theme.json` files, which we might want to use depending on the requirements for customizability. Likewise, [SASS / SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) support can be added if it makes life easier for the developer(s) involved. But as we already use PostCSS to control autorprefixing and [cssnano](https://cssnano.co) minification, we can also use it to support the latest and even upcoming CSS sytax like [native CSS nesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/) (TODO).

TypeScript / ECMAScript transpilation can also be set up (TODO). In the current state of this template, any JavaScript code will be exportet exactly as it has been written, as the original example was focused on CSS development.

## Inspection

To facilitate debugging, `plugins` is mounted as a local directory, so you can search files and view error messages and annotations, to collect details for filing issues or for creating patches yourself.

You can enter the Docker container and use it much like a remote server.

Type

`docker exec -it wordpress_setup_test_wordpress_1 bash`

Replace `wp_cli_docker_wordpress_1` with the appropriate name found in `docker ps`, if necessary.

Inside the docker container, you will find WordPress in `/var/www/html`.

## Stop, Clean Up, Uninstall

- stop the current server by exiting the process (by pressing `Ctrl C` or your operating system's break key), or type
- `npm stop`

After stopping the server, the data will still be ready for another session and for inspection and backup of plugin files.

Use

`npm run destroy`

to remove the installation.

## Development

Follow the [detailled WordPress plugin development guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/).

In JetBrains IDEA (PhpStorm, WebStorm, etc.) enable WordPress support and set `wp_data` as WordPress path, so that the local code inspections like SonarLint can recognize the built-in functions. You can still mark the directory as excluded to avoid unnecessary indexing and search results.

Some SonarLint warnings (and PHP PSR conventions) should be ignored, like avoiding underscores in function names. As we operate in a global namespace shared with other plugins, it is considered best practice to use a unique prefix for identifiers used for `function`, `class`, and `define`.

A local code sniffer validation can be set up using the provided `composer.json` configuration. Note that this currently does not work with PHP 8, so you need to use a PHP 7.4 runtime (`/usr/bin/php74`). You may need to adjust the IDE settings to WordPress coding standards and code sniffer configurations according to the provided tutorial.

### Child Themes and Editor Styles Specificity

As mentioned in the [child-theme chapter of the WordPress theme developer handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/), different themes might use different ways to load their theme styles and editor styles, so we might have to adapt our loading mechanism accordingly.

Some themes automatically load child theme styles, so that we would not need any custom `functions.php` code. But we can still use a `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook with two `wp_enqueue_style` function calls to state the styles' dependency explicitly.

To apply our (child) theme styles in the (Gutenberg) block editor, we have to `add_theme_support` for `editor-styles` and add  our `theme.css` using `add_editor_style` as [described in the block editor handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-support/). This will wrap our frontend styles in an `.editor-styles-wrapper` which is the modern equivant of the class editor's iframe body.

It is still a good idea to ensure that our child theme styles override parent styles using CSS specificity, as [suggested by GeneratePress support](https://generatepress.com/forums/topic/child-theme-css-precedence/). This makes our theme more robust as it will not have to rely on the loading order.

Note that a `body` selector will be automatically replaced by `.editor-styles-wrapper` which would have been added anyway, so no higher specificity in the backend, and that the semantic landmark elements `main`, `article` and `header` are missing inside the block editor preview, and there is no `.site`  There is an `.editor-styles-wrapper .wp-block-post-content`, but we would not want to add backend-specific selectors to our frontend styles. Using a `body div` wrapper is not the most elegant workaround either.

In case that we only need the markup generated by the parent theme, we could dequeue the parent the style and omit any specificity wrappers altogether.

In future themes, we might want to support the new WordPress style engine and use `theme.json`, but we don't necessarily need to. See [Managing CSS Styles in a WordPress Block Theme by Ganesh Dahal on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/managing-css-styles-in-a-wordpress-block-theme/) for more details.

## Code Style and Exceptions

Code style should follow WordPress coding style guide, unless that's outdated or does not apply due to a valid reason. The project setup has configured PHP code sniffer, eslint, and stylelint rules.

We might want to use `var` in JavaScript to produce even more backward compatible code.

We might want to use BEM style underscores, which had been disallowed by the classic WordPress style guide, but seem to be used by the Gutenberg team, as discussed here: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28616#issuecomment-770596122 , which also allow descending specificity as the rule seems to produce too many false positives in modular projects.

CSS class names don't follow a concise system due to the different existing class names used by WordPress core, base blocks, and the GeneratePress parent theme.

## Block Library

We can provide blocks of our own, that can be composed, reused, and modified by content creators.

## Troubleshooting

- make sure that there is no other local service listening on port 8765 or configure another port.
